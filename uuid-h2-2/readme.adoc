= Schema creation for UUID identifiers broken on H2 2.0

Entities with identifiers of type `UUID` work on H2 1.4.200 but fail on 2.0.202 if Hibernate is tasked to create the schema for the model.
Data can be persisted but neither JPA lookups, nor finder or delete queries by identifier work.

A difference I can spot in the logs is that for 1.4.200 the table is created as follows:

.On H2 1.4.200
[source]
----
create table MyOrder (id binary not null, primary key (id))
----

while it looks like this on 2.0.202:

.On H2 2.0.202
[source]
----
create table MyOrder (id binary(255) not null, primary key (id))
----

I'm wildly guessing that due to the dedicated length specified for 2.0 the parameter value would have to be padded to actually let the query match?
Does it make sense to rather restrict the columns to a length more appropriate for UUIDs?

It works fine on Hibernate 6 as that uses H2's native UUID type:

.Hibernate 6 CR1 on H2 2.0.202
[source]
----
create table MyOrder (id uuid not null, primary key (id))
----
